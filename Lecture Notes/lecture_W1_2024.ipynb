    "# From ChatGPT: Python can handle a wide variety of objects, allowing you to work with simple data structures, complex collections, and user-defined objects. Here’s a rundown of the types of objects Python can handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in data types, each serving different purposes. Here’s a summary of the main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numeric Types\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tint: Integer values (e.g., 10, -5).\n",
    "\t•\tfloat: Floating-point numbers, used for decimal values (e.g., 3.14, -0.001).\n",
    "\t•\tcomplex: Complex numbers, which have a real and an imaginary part (e.g., 3 + 5j).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sequence Types\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tstr: String, a sequence of characters (e.g., \"hello\").\n",
    "\t•\tlist: A mutable ordered collection of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 'apple']).\n",
    "\t•\ttuple: An immutable ordered collection (e.g., (1, 2, 3, 'apple')).\n",
    "\t•\trange: Represents a sequence of numbers (e.g., range(0, 5)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mapping Type\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tdict: A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique (e.g., {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Set Types\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tset: An unordered collection of unique items (e.g., {1, 2, 3, 'apple'}).\n",
    "\t•\tfrozenset: An immutable version of a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Boolean Type\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tbool: Represents True or False values, often used in logical operations (e.g., True, False).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Binary Types\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tbytes: Immutable sequence of bytes (e.g., b'hello').\n",
    "\t•\tbytearray: Mutable sequence of bytes.\n",
    "\t•\tmemoryview: A memory view object, useful for efficient data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. None Type\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tNoneType: Represents the absence of a value, typically shown as None.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type can be checked using type() and has its own methods for operations and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\t-\tFunction objects: Python functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Classes and Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "\t-\tClasses: Blueprints for creating objects with attributes and methods.\n",
    "\t-\tInstances: Objects created from a class. They can have unique attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Modules and Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "\t-\tModules: Files containing Python code, including functions, classes, and variables. Python modules are objects and can be imported.\n",
    "\t-\tPackages: Collections of modules grouped in directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Generators and Iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "\t-\tGenerators: Special functions that yield values one at a time, allowing efficient iteration without storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",
    "\t-\tIterators: Objects that represent a stream of data. Iterators are used to traverse collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Specialized Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "\t-\tNamedtuples: Immutable collections with named fields (from the collections module).\n",
    "\t-\tDeque: Double-ended queue (from the collections module).\n",
    "\t-\tCounter: Specialized dictionary for counting hashable objects (from the collections module).\n",
    "\t-\tOrderedDict: Dictionary that maintains the order of items (from the collections module).\n",
    "\t-\tDefaultdict: Dictionary that provides default values for missing keys (from the collections module).\n",
    "\n",
    "13. User-Defined Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "\t-\tPython allows you to create custom objects using classes, where you can define unique properties and methods for the objects you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. File and Network Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "\t-\tFile objects: Used for reading and writing files.\n",
    "\t-\tSocket objects: Used for handling network connections and communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Context Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "\t-\tWith Objects: Objects that control resource management, like files, with the with statement, ensuring proper cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s flexibility with objects is a key feature that enables complex programming patterns and powerful abstractions. Each object has specific attributes and methods, and they are all derived from Python’s root object class, allowing customization and polymorphism.\n",
